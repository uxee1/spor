    <p>Sports are organized physical activities that involve skill, strategy, and competition, often played according to established rules or regulations. They can be individual or team-based and usually require a combination of physical exertion, mental focus, and teamwork. The primary goals in sports typically include achieving a specific outcome, such as scoring points or completing a task, while also fostering personal development, teamwork, and fair play. Beyond mere competition, sports often serve as a means for social interaction, cultural expression, and entertainment, providing opportunities for people to engage in healthy lifestyles and build communities.</p>

    <p >Football, or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each, aiming to score goals by getting a ball into the opposing team’s net. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end and lasts 90 minutes, divided into two halves. Players can use any part of their body except their arms and hands (the goalkeeper is an exception). Key rules include the offside rule, which prevents players from gaining an unfair advantage, and various ways to restart play such as throw-ins, corner kicks, and penalty kicks. Football's global appeal is reflected in its numerous domestic leagues, continental tournaments, and international competitions like the FIFA World Cup, making it the world’s most popular sport.</p>

    <p>Handball is a fast-paced team sport played on a rectangular court, where two teams of seven players each (including a goalkeeper) aim to score goals by throwing a small ball into the opponent's net. The game is typically played indoors, but outdoor versions exist as well. Players use their hands to pass, dribble, and shoot the ball, and the match is usually divided into two halves, each lasting 30 minutes. Unlike many other sports, players are allowed to take a few steps while holding the ball before passing or shooting, and physical contact is permitted to a certain extent. Key aspects of handball include quick transitions between defense and attack, strategic positioning, and effective teamwork. The sport combines elements of speed, agility, and precision, and is governed by a set of rules designed to maintain fairness and flow of the game.</p>

    <p>Basketball is a dynamic team sport played on a rectangular court where two teams of five players each aim to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop mounted 10 feet (3.05 meters) high at each end of the court. The game is typically divided into four quarters, each lasting 10 or 12 minutes, depending on the league. Players advance the ball by dribbling or passing and must avoid violations such as traveling (moving without dribbling) and double dribbling (switching hands while dribbling). Points are scored by making field goals (2 or 3 points depending on the distance from the hoop) and free throws (1 point each). Key elements of the game include strategic offense and defense, rebounding, and teamwork. Basketball emphasizes both physical skill and tactical strategy, making it a fast-paced and engaging sport.</p>

    <p>A tennis ball is a small, rubber sphere used in the sport of tennis. It is covered with a layer of felt, which is typically yellow or green, and is designed to be lightweight and bouncy. The standard diameter of a tennis ball is about 2.57 to 2.70 inches (6.54 to 6.86 cm), and it weighs between 1.98 and 2.10 ounces (56.7 to 59.4 grams). The felt covering helps the ball grip the strings of the racket and interact with the surface of the court, affecting its speed, spin, and bounce. Tennis balls are pressurized, which contributes to their bounce and performance, and they are designed to endure the impact of repeated strikes and the wear of playing surfaces.</p>
